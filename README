iOS Path Kit Framework

Current version: Draft 0.3 (design-focused, non-optimized).

Purpose:
	- Building and manipulating paths.
	- Displaying paths with OpenGL.
	
Classes:
	- LinearPath: simple start-end path.
	- LinearWaypointPath: path with waypoints connected by lines.
	- TrackingPath: linear path that changes its destination by tracking the target.
	- PathWalker: class to walk through all paths.
	- PathViewLine: displaying whole path as a line.
	- FuturePathViewLine: displaying part of path from current position to destination as a line.
	- PastPathViewLine: displaying part of path from start to current position as a line.
	- FuturePathViewTexture: textured version of FuturePathViewLine.
	- PastPathViewTexture: textured version of PastPathViewLine.
	- StripPathBuilder: building VBO for given path.
	
Features:
	- Uses OpenGL calls for rendering: independent from current graphics engine.
	- Uses CoreGraphics types and functions for operation.
	- Uses VBOs to display paths.
	
Samples:
	- Whiteboard: simple iPad UIKit application that uses LinearWaypointPath and PathViewLine to make and display drawings.
